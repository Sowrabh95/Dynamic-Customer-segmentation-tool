**Feature Selection:** Dynamically choose relevant features for clustering.

**Optimal Cluster Detection:** Determines the best number of clusters using the Silhouette Score.

**K-Means Clustering:** Automatically applies K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters.

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluates clustering performance using:

Silhouette Score (higher is better)

Davies-Bouldin Index (lower is better)

**Visualization:** Displays customer segmentation results using a scatter plot.
